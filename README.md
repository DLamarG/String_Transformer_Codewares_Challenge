# String_Transformer_Codewares_Challenge
Given a string, return a new string that has transformed based on the input:
<br>
Change case of every character, ie. lower case to upper case, upper case to lower case.
Reverse the order of words from the input.
Note: You will have to handle multiple spaces, and leading/trailing spaces.

For example:
<br>
"Example Input" ==> "iNPUT eXAMPLE"
